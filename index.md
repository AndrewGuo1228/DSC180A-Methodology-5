1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interesting topic was using cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation to ensure privacy-preserving data analytics on decentralized platforms. 
It was fascinating to explore how data analysis can be performed without revealing raw data. Besides, using solidity to code smart contract on remix is also an eye-opening experience.

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

Since our current project is more like a software development, so I would like to take it further by implement some data analysis part,
such as implementing some recommendation system feature for our data marketplace, using the popularity of a dataset to evaluatethe data value and dynamically
adjust the price, and etc.

3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

I would consider integrating zero-knowledge proofs earlier in the process to verify the integrity of data transactions without revealing any details.
This could enhance trust and reduce the overhead associated with data verification.

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I am interested in incorporating techniques like federated learning with differential privacy and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) into our decentralized data marketplace. 
Federated learning would enable multiple data providers to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing raw data, ensuring privacy by only exchanging encrypted model updates. 
By adding differential privacy, even if these updates were intercepted, individual data points would remain protected. 
Additionally, ZKPs would allow data scientists to prove the correctness of their analyses on encrypted data without revealing the data itself, thereby enhancing trust in our analytics marketplace.
Combining these with secure multi-party computation (SMPC) could enable collaborative analytics across decentralized datasets while preserving data confidentiality, creating a more secure and privacy-centric platform for our users.
